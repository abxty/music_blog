ZSL Freestyle is a lost gem that I had the utmost fortune of finding. This track samples the beat from *Throw It in the Bag* by Fabolous (I think — there wasn’t much information on the sample), and Zino absolutely kills it.

The energy, production, and wordplay on this track are unmatched. I found it through an Instagram reel from Zino, and it was a genuine struggle to find the full song online, although it is available on SoundCloud.

The beat has been sampled a few times by other UK artists like Blimeydog, who I’ll definitely be reviewing later, but in my opinion Zino murders this beat harder than anyone else. Him repeating *“Rap is Art”* really encapsulates his love for the game.

In my opinion, no one can match this guy’s energy and passion for rap. You can hear it in his delivery and output, and I truly think he’s going to go global at some point. This track differs a lot from his other work, but this is where Zino is really in his bag.

This has been my most played track for the past few weeks and will probably stay that way. Overall, Zino represents exactly why the UK scene is thriving — hunger for success, love for the craft, and an ear for addictive beats. What a track.
