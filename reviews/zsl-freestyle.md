# Zino Vinci – ZSL Freestyle

## TRACK OVERVIEW

ZSL Freestyle is a gem that I had the utmost fortune of finding. I found it through an Instagram reel from Zino, and it was a genuine struggle to find the full song online, although it is available on SoundCloud. So Zino, I beg of you, DROP THIS ON SPOTIFY BRO.

This track samples the beat from *Throw It in the Bag* by Fabolous (I think this is the origin of the beat — there wasn’t much information on the sample), and Zino absolutely kills it. At a runtime of 3:32, Zino really displays his wordplay and ability to flow on a beat.

## TRACK REVIEW

The energy, production, and wordplay on this track are unmatched. The first verse hits incredibly hard, and the wordplay is honestly a testament to Zino's talent.

For me though, his verse from 2:05 - 2:42 is his best rapping performance to date. He enters a flow state and produces endless one liners that all meld perfectly together, a generational performance.

I have to recognise Zino's beat selection ability, he always comes with banger beats, and this beat works perfectly for his style.

In my opinion, no one can match this guy’s energy and passion for rap. This track differs a lot from his other work, and I really hope he puts more tracks out like this, as this is where Zino is really in his bag.

This has been my most played track for the past few weeks and will probably stay that way. Overall, Zino represents exactly why the UK scene is thriving — hunger for success, love for the craft, and an ear for addictive beats. What a track.
