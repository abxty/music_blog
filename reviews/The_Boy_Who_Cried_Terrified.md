## Fakemink - The boy who cried terrified

## EP OVERVIEW

The boy who cried terrified is Fakemink’s first multi-track release in over 2 years. Since London’s Saviour’s great reception (rightly so), a lot of people were expecting a similar level of greatness with his next project, but did he deliver?

This EP is a prelude to Mink’s announced album, “Terrified”. The intention of this EP is to, of course, generate hype, buzz and excitement for the main project, however, for me at least, this EP has done the opposite. This is a 7 track project, and after listening to all seven tracks three times over, I can confidently say some of these tracks are his worst music to date.

Overall, it simply feels lazy, this doesn’t sound like the Mink that locked himself in his room for weeks to produce London Saviour, this sounds like a guy who’s reached incredible heights and gotten comfortable at the top. In my opinion this sentiment has been echoed in his social media activity. From his pointless beef with Nettspend, where they sent subliminals for weeks for apparently no reason, to his strange, arguably homophobic comments on IG Lives, it feels as though Mink has let his attention slip a little from the music, and as a result we get this half baked, 7 track EP, of which almost half completely falls flat in achieving the same sort of impact his previous project had.

While there are good tracks here, especially in the second half, for such a talented and promising artist, gearing up for his biggest release to date, this does not deliver.

## FULL TRACKLIST REVIEW

### TRACK 1: Blow the speaker

The first track is blow the speaker, which starts with some heavenly strings, but then unfortunately we hear Mink’s infamous autotune voice. This is complete personal opinion but I really dislike his voice when autotuned, it just simply doesn’t sound good. As the name suggests, Mink is trying to blow your speakers with the 808 in this track, I am a lover of bass boosted music but this is to the point where the strings and Mink himself are being overpowered by it. In fairness, I like the jerk drums, and as I said the strings sound amazing, it’s just a shame that Mink opted for the over the top autotune and 808.

### TRACK 2: Young Millionaire

Similarly to the first track, Mink starts off well, the beat on this is very jerk inspired, it’s bouncy and infectious, mainly due in part to the 808 and drums. Again however where this track fails is in Mink’s delivery and lyrical content. This is really just a flex track, for around half of the runtime Mink is either repeating “Young millionaire yeah I feel like Weezy”, or he’s groaning into the mic.

I’ll be the first to argue against rap purists who claim a good hip hop song has to have double entendres and insane wordplay, but this song is simply just boring to listen to, his delivery is lazy, and lacks any passion or expression, and when the lyrics are similarly uninspired you’re left with a crazy beat, but wanting more. This will be a common sentiment throughout this project, as unfortunately this rings true for many of the songs on this EP.

### TRACK 3: Dumb

This is easily the worst song on the EP. Seriously, and I’m not overstating here, this is unlistenable. On my first listen I had to remove my headphones as it was giving me a headache hearing this.

Again, we’re introduced to the track with a great beat: an interesting synth and a slightly uninspired but still catchy jerk drum pattern. And for the first 20 seconds, we hear some promise, while Mink’s delivery isn’t great, he’s coherent, he’s rhyming and his delivery is solid, however past the 20 second mark this track devolves into Mink’s vocals being completely unbalanced, with him being significantly louder than the beat.

And to make it worse, he starts to moan his lyrics, repeating the line “I love when a bad bitch act dumb” to such a point that he is almost incoherent. This lazy delivery lasts until the 1:15 mark where we somehow get worse. Mink starts moaning in a higher pitched, almost shrill tone, still repeating that same line. This lasts until the end of the track, and really leaves a sour taste for the entire track.

In fairness, this could simply be a taste difference, I’m sure there is a group of fans out there that love this track, but for me this is all the worst parts of Mink, and I really hope he doesn’t take this direction for his album.

### TRACK 4: Mr Chow

I know I sound like a broken record by now but again we’ve got a strong start, Mink’s experimentation with synths is so cool to hear, and as a producer myself I’m consistently left stunned and almost jealous of his ability to create new and interesting synth sounds.

This entire track is most certainly an improvement on the first 3. This time, Mink comes in with significantly more energy than the previous tracks, he’s got some solid wordplay and some catchy delivery.

What slightly bugs me about this track is really how the verses have been constructed, to me, each of Mink’s lines fade in and out way too quickly. To the point where before you’ve processed what he’s just said he’s already said his next line, resulting in it being hard to understand or appreciate what it is he’s talking about.

Overall, this track is very pleasing from a musical aesthetic point of view. I like this sound, I like this direction, and with some tweaks and practice I’d love to hear more of this sound from Mink.

### TRACK 5: The Mercer

The Mercer gives a satisfying relief from the more aggressive performance and beats we’ve heard from Mink in the previous tracks. The beat is much more chilled, almost lofi in some senses, with him using some creative reversing of a sample to achieve this really cool, trippy sound.

My main qualms with this track are two things: the track length, at 1:35 the track’s simply not given enough time to develop into something meaningful, and the lyrical content. A lot of these tracks have been very braggadocious, but it really gets to the point of over the top here.

Overall a good track, and a much better performance in every aspect than the first few.

### TRACK 6: Milk & Honey

This is what I wanted to hear. Great song. All the parts of what makes Fakemink so good.

Simple, yet such an ear pleasing beat, such a creative drum pattern, such a satisfying synth. When that crazy synth hits at 0:55 you’re floating.

On this track we finally get a great performance from Mink. This track is everything I wanted from him, more of this is what we need.

### TRACK 7: fml

He’s delivered again with the beat. An airy, heavily reverbed synth with yet another catchy and bouncy drum beat.

Despite some repetitive bragging, his delivery is on point and matches the vibe well. Overall, a good, listenable track with some lowlights, but certainly more highlights.

## FINAL VERDICT

Overall, this project is a very mixed bag. The first 3 songs are incredibly disappointing, and while the latter half improves, only *Milk & Honey* truly shines.

Final score: **4/10**
