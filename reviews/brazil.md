## Deathtoricky - Brazil

Death To Ricky was my most listened-to artist of 2025, so it’s no wonder that one of my first reviews is *Brazil*. For me, this track is Ricky at his absolute best.

The beat is infectious, he bounces on it effortlessly, and the lyrics are just fun and easy to listen to. Ricky really proved himself with *IKFLY*, but since then he’s only improved. Tracks like *Ronda Rousey* and *Beepin* have cemented him as an underground GOAT.

The fact that he produces almost all of his own beats only strengthens that claim. To me, there’s no one else making music that’s as consistently fun and enjoyable as Ricky’s. Irish rappers are rare, and they shouldn’t be — there’s so much talent in Ireland, and Ricky is right at the forefront.

*Brazil* is a top three Ricky track for me. The sample is incredibly creative, the drums complement it perfectly, and Ricky glides across the beat. Call it glaze if you want, but he’s genuinely approaching GOAT status.

Fuck with it or don’t, bozo.
