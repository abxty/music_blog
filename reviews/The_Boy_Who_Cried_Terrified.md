The boy who cried terrified is Fakemink's first multi-track release in over 2 years. Since London's Saviour's great reception (rightly so), a lot of people were expecting a similar level of greatness with his next project, but did he deliver?

THIS IS AN UNFINISHED REVIEW.

EP OVERVIEW:

This EP is a prelude to Mink's announced album, "Terrified". The intention of this EP is to, of course, generate hype, buzz and excitement for the main project, however, for me at least, this EP has done the opposite. This is a 7 track project, and after listening to all seven tracks three times over, I can confidently say some of these tracks are his worst music to date. Overall, it simply feels lazy, this doesn't sound like the Mink that locked himself in his room for weeks to produce London Saviour, this sounds like a guy who's reached incredible heights, and gotten comfortable at the top. In my opinion this sentiment has been echoed in his social media activity. From his pointless beef with Nettspend, to his strange comments on IG Lives, it feels as though Mink has let his attention slip a little from the music, and as a result we get this half baked, 7 track EP, of which over half of it just sounds like noise.

FULL TRACKLIST REVIEW:

The first track is blow the speaker, which starts with some heavenly strings, but then unfortunately we hear Mink's infamous autotune voice, this is complete personal opinion but I really dislike his voice when autotuned, it just simply doesn't sound good. As the name suggests, Mink is trying to blow your speakers with the 808 in this track, I am a lover of bass boosted music but this is to the point of where the strings and Mink himself is being overpowered by it. In fairness, I like the jerk drums, and as I said the strings sound amazing, its just a shame that Mink opted for the over the top autotune and 808.
