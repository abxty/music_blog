## Jdrly - Canvas

jdrly is an artist that’s been heavy on the rise for the past year or so, with this rise culminating in the release of his track *canvas*. He’s been heavily promoting it on TikTok (which is where I found it).

The track samples Aphex Twin’s *Xtal*, this sample adds such a dreamy and airy vibe to the track, something found in a lot of JD’s tracks.

The drum beat as well just adds another layer of vibe, the way it kicks in on the drop is an undeniable vibe. This track shows a lot of potential from JD, I’d say it’s levels above any other track he’s released.

While you could criticise him for the simple lyrics of the song, I’d argue that sometimes lyrics you don’t have to overthink are perfect for this sort of sound.

In all, JD isn’t necessarily doing anything revolutionary, but he’s perfected an immaculate vibe and I’ll be looking very intently for his next track, definitely worth a listen.
