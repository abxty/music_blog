The boy who cried terrified is Fakemink’s first multi-track release in over 2 years. Since London’s Saviour’s great reception (rightly so), a lot of people were expecting a similar level of greatness with his next project, but did he deliver?

EP OVERVIEW:

This EP is a prelude to Mink’s announced album, “Terrified”. The intention of this EP is to, of course, generate hype, buzz and excitement for the main project, however, for me at least, this EP has done the opposite. This is a 7 track project, and after listening to all seven tracks three times over, I can confidently say some of these tracks are his worst music to date. Overall, it simply feels lazy, this doesn’t sound like the Mink that locked himself in his room for weeks to produce London Saviour, this sounds like a guy who’s reached incredible heights, and gotten comfortable at the top. In my opinion this sentiment has been echoed in his social media activity. From his pointless beef with Nettspend, where they sent subliminals for weeks for apparently no reason, to his strange, arguably homophobic comments on IG Lives, it feels as though Mink has let his attention slip a little from the music, and as a result we get this half baked, 7 track EP, of which almost half completely falls flat in achieving the same sort of impact his previous project had. While there are good tracks here, especially in the second half, for such a talented and promising artist, gearing up for his biggest release to date, this does not deliver.

FULL TRACKLIST REVIEW:

TRACK 1: Blow the speaker.

The first track is blow the speaker, which starts with some heavenly strings, but then unfortunately we hear Mink’s infamous autotune voice. This is complete personal opinion but I really dislike his voice when autotuned, it just simply doesn’t sound good. As the name suggests, Mink is trying to blow your speakers with the 808 in this track, I am a lover of bass boosted music but this is to the point where the strings and Mink himself are being overpowered by it. In fairness, I like the jerk drums, and as I said the strings sound amazing, it’s just a shame that Mink opted for the over the top autotune and 808.

TRACK 2: Young Millionaire.

Similarly to the first track, Mink starts off well, the beat on this is very jerk inspired, it’s bouncy and infectious, mainly due in part to the 808 and drums. Again however where this track fails is in Mink’s delivery and lyrical content. This is really just a flex track, for around half of the runtime Mink is either repeating “Young millionaire yeah I feel like Weezy”, or he’s groaning into the mic. I’ll be the first to argue against rap purists who claim a good hip hop song has to have double entendres and insane wordplay, but this song is simply just boring to listen to, his delivery is lazy, and lacks any passion or expression, and when the lyrics are similarly uninspired you’re left with a crazy beat, but wanting more. This will be a common sentiment throughout this project, as unfortunately this rings true for many of the songs on this EP.

TRACK 3: Dumb.

This is easily the worst song on the EP. Seriously, and I’m not overstating here, this is unlistenable. On my first listen I had to remove my headphones as it was giving me a headache hearing this. AGAIN, we’re introduced to the track with a great beat: an interesting synth and a slightly uninspired but still catchy jerk drum pattern. And for the first 20 seconds, we hear some promise, while Mink’s delivery isn’t great, he’s coherent, he’s rhyming and his delivery is solid, however past the 20 second mark this track devolves into Mink’s vocals being completely unbalanced, with him being significantly louder than the beat. And to make it worse, he starts to moan his lyrics, repeating the line “I love when a bad bitch act dumb” to such a point that he is almost incoherent. This lazy delivery lasts until the 1:15 mark where we somehow get worse. Mink starts moaning in a higher pitched, almost shrill tone, still repeating that same line. This lasts until the end of the track, and really leaves a sour taste for the entire track. In fairness, this could simply be a taste difference, I’m sure there is a group of fans out there that love this track, but for me this is all the worst parts of Mink, and I really hope he doesn’t take this direction for his album.

TRACK 4: Mr Chow.

I know I sound like a broken record by now but again we’ve got a strong start, Mink’s experimentation with synths is so cool to hear, and as a producer myself I’m consistently left stunned and almost jealous of his ability to create new and interesting synth sounds. This entire track is most certainly an improvement on the first 3. This time, Mink comes in with significantly more energy than the previous tracks, he’s got some solid wordplay and some catchy delivery. What slightly bugs me about this track is really how the verses have been constructed, to me, each of Mink’s lines fade in and out way too quickly. To the point where before you’ve processed what he’s just said he’s already said his next line, resulting in it being hard to understand or appreciate what it is he’s talking about. This is an injustice as his vocal performance is good, and if we were given just a bit more time between each line to appreciate this, the track would’ve stuck out a lot more. Overall, this track is very pleasing from a musical aesthetic point of view. I like this sound, I like this direction, and with some tweaks and practice I’d love to hear more of this sound from Mink.

TRACK 5: The Mercer.

The Mercer gives a satisfying relief from the more aggressive performance and beats we’ve heard from Mink in the previous tracks. The beat is much more chilled, almost lofi in some senses, with him using some creative reversing of a sample to achieve this really cool, trippy sound. This whole EP is heavily jerk inspired, with all the drum patterns being very jerk-centric, which I really like, but I know a lot of Mink fans don’t appreciate so I think this track will be a controversial one. My main qualms with this track are 2 things: the track length, at 1:35 the track’s simply not given enough time to develop into something meaningful, it almost feels like an extended snippet to a great Mink song. And the second thing is the lyrical content. A lot of these tracks have been very braggadocious, but it really gets to the point of over the top here. He repeats “You’re washed and I’m great” and “I spent 5 bands today”. I’m all for rappers hyping themselves up, but only when it adds something, because here all he’s really doing is telling us how good and rich he is. We get it, you deserve all the flowers, you’re a young, successful and talented artist, but when you present it in this way it just comes off as arrogance. Some may claim jealousy but in all honesty I just don’t enjoy that type of lyrical content, it feels overused and cheap at times. Overall a good track, and a much better performance in every aspect than the first few, good direction, keep it up Mink.

TRACK 6: Milk & Honey.

This, now this is what I wanted to hear, this is what I expected. Great song. All the parts of what makes Fakemink so good. Simple, yet such an ear pleasing beat, such a creative drum pattern, such a satisfying synth yet again. And when that crazy synth hits at 0:55 you’re floating. On this track we finally get a great performance from Mink, he comes with his funny one liners he’s known for like “I be getting money it’s funny cus I’m an idiot”, and also some good, and meaningful lyrics. His delivery is also great, he flows very well and his tone and speed really complement the more chilled beat. I guess my only criticism of this track is that we know he is capable of this, so why were we getting tracks like Dumb? He has the capability to produce pure ear candy, the fact he creates almost all his own beats is a testament to this, so much talent at such a young age, which is why it’s so disappointing, and why I’m so scathing, when I hear songs like Dumb. However, I digress, this track is everything I wanted from Mink, more of this is what we need, and it’s what he needs to recognise as his best work, a certain playlist addition.

TRACK 7: fml.

What am I going to say? He’s delivered again with the beat. An airy, heavily reverbed synth with yet another catchy and bouncy drum beat, especially the snare and clicks really add to this. But as with many of the tracks on this EP he slightly lets himself down with the vocal content. This track features more of that lazy bragging I mentioned earlier, and by this point, on the final track, I’ve grown even more bored by it. However, despite this, his delivery is on point, and it matches the vibe and beat very well, it’s more laid back, and he really finds some pockets on the song where he weaves between the beat incredibly well. The verse starting from 1:16, while slightly repetitive, is very infectious and catchy, and for me saves the track from being another forgettable performance, especially with how much he let himself down with the first verse due to the aforementioned repetition. Throughout this project one thing I can compliment Mink for is his production and mastering, bar a few moments (throwback to the balancing nightmare on Dumb), the use of reverb and delay on his vocals throughout this track is exceptional, and he’s mastered the understanding of what complements his vocal performances, something a lot of newer producers/artists struggle with. Overall, a good, listenable track with some lowlights, but certainly more highlights.

Overall, this project is a very mixed bag, with the first 3 songs preparing you for the most disappointing release in a long time, however Mink slightly brings it back with the latter 4 tracks. The problem for me, however, is that the last 4 tracks are not amazing (other than Milk & Honey), which means they really don’t make up for the incredible disappointment of the first 3, so in all, I will be giving this EP a 4/10, and I am really hoping the full project does not take the same direction as this EP, and Mink forgets his ego and listens to the criticism, takes it on board, and delivers us a project we all know he is capable of.
