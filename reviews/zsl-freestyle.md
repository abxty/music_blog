TRACK OVERVIEW:

ZSL Freestyle is a gem that I had the utmost fortune of finding. I found it through an Instagram reel from Zino, and it was a genuine struggle to find the full song online, although it is available on SoundCloud. So Zino, I beg of you, DROP THIS ON SPOTIFY BRO. 

This track samples the beat from *Throw It in the Bag* by Fabolous (I think this is the origin of the beat — there wasn’t much information on the sample), and Zino absolutely kills it. At a runtime of 3:32, Zino really displays his wordplay and ability to flow on a beat. As for the beat, it is like a cheatcode to a banger song, it alone just lifts the vibe incredibly, and when acompanied by Zino's unmatched energy we're left a track that gives you the same feeling as being in a spoons with your mates at 1am after just banging a snus (luv u jim).

TRACK REVIEW:
As mentioned, the energy, production, and wordplay on this track are unmatched. the beat has been sampled a few times by other UK artists like Blimeydog, who I’ll definitely be reviewing later, but in my opinion Zino murders this beat harder than anyone else. The first verse on this track hits incredibly hard, the wordplay in this verse is honestly a testament to Zino's talent. While Zino has always had an incredible flow, you'd be forgiven for thinking his wordplay wasn't as strong if you'd only heard of him from his hit *CEO of the friendship group* (while this is still a banger), but Zino absolutely proves that assumption wrong with this first verse alone.

For me though, his verse from 2:05 - 2:42 is his best rapping performance to date. The feeling I get when this verse plays is like no other songs given me (forgive the glaze), this guy literally enters flow state and just starts producing endless one liners, one after the other, and they all just meld so well, generational performance.

I'm going to refrain from yapping about the beat too much, as obviously this is a fully sampled beat and has been used quite a few times, so not too much credit can be directly given to zino for it (plus I have no clue who produced this again, TS IS NOT ON SPOTIFY). But I have to recognise Zino's beat selection ability, he always comes with banger beats, and he certainly has an ear for what beats work with his style, and this ability is on best display on his choice to use this beat, it just works perfectly.

In my opinion, no one can match this guy’s energy and passion for rap. You can hear it in his delivery and output, and I truly think he’s going to go global soon come. What really sums up this guys love for the game is a line he repeats often in ZSL, *“Rap is Art”*, you can hear in his work that he truly lives and believes this, and I entirely agree. This track differs a lot from his other work, and I really hope he puts more trakcs out like this, as this is where Zino is really in his bag.

This has been my most played track for the past few weeks and will probably stay that way, it's addicting and just sounds better and better every time I play it. Overall, Zino represents exactly why the UK scene is thriving — hunger for success, love for the craft, and an ear for addictive beats. What a track.
